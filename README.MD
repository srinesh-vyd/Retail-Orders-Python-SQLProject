## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to perform basic data analysis using SQL in a MySQL database. The process involved:

1. Downloading a dataset from Kaggle.
2. Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Cleaning and transforming the data.
4. Loading the transformed data into a MySQL database.
5. Analyzing the dataset using SQL queries.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- SQLAlchemy & PyODBC: For connecting to the MySQL database.
- MySQL: For storing and querying the dataset.
- Jupyter Notebook: For developing the entire workflow.
- Kaggle API: To download the dataset programmatically.
